            <p align="left" style="background-color: aqua;"> COVID-19 is a serious pandemic at this moment. The coronavirus is
                spreading quickly and easily between humans. Doctors and heath workers are working hard to cure the affected patient. So our group M6 come up with an idea of a robot named MBOT. It can distribute food and medicine to corona patient inside a COVID ward. This robot can help frontline COVID-19 warriors – nurses, doctors and other health care staff to avoid direct contact with patient and being exposed to the virus. MBOT can connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth and uses GPS to navigate. All the electronics will be
                contained in the base so that other things can be carried as well. The doctors and other staff can also video chat with patient through a camera fixed on the top of robot, in order to monitor there health. It will also provided with the feature of touchless hand senitizer, so that they can senitize themselves before collecting food. Hospital can be divided in GREEN ZONE( for doctors, other staff and non-covid positive people) and RED ZONE ( for corona patient). We are also thinking to make it self dis-infecting by fogging method, so it can disinfect it self before retuning to heath care workers staying within green zone. Because of this robot doctors and heath staff can concentrate on caring of patient, rather than worrying about missing medicine and supplies. </p>

            <p align="left">The main and important components of our robot are Aurdino, Motor driver,
                motor, Batteries, and sensors.
                The manufacturing process starts by installing Aurdino with a motor driver and
                then attached all 4 motors with a motor driver and sensors with Aurdino. Then
                we connect batteries to Aurdino. After attaching and all the soldering process we
                fix it in our rectangular robot base. Then we go ahead with the manufacturing
                body of our robot.
                In our product that is “Medicare Robot” (MBOT), only the main component is
                the body of our robot which is of wood. We have to manufacture that only. Except
                for the body of our robot every component we need to buy from the market, like
                battery, motor, wires, sensors, etc. We don’t need any manufacturing process in
                that.
                The body of MBOT is made up of plywood. we first cut the ply in the required
                dimension then we assemble it to the required shape and fit it with a steel screw.
                And at last, we install inner components in the body. and then external
                components ie sanitizer and smartphone.
                The body of our MBOT is of wood. We need a carpentry shop to manufacture the
                body of our robot. </p>
